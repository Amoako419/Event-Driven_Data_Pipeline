## Project Overview

This project implements a **real-time, event-driven data pipeline** for an e-commerce platform to support operational analytics. The pipeline processes transactional data (orders, products, etc.) arriving in flat-file format into an Amazon S3 bucket. The system validates, transforms, and computes business KPIs from the data, storing the results in Amazon DynamoDB for real-time querying.

The solution leverages **AWS-native services** in a containerized setup to ensure scalability, reliability, and automation.

---

## System Architecture

The architecture is designed to handle end-to-end processing of incoming data files. Below is a high-level overview:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Files are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. **Event Triggering**: Amazon EventBridge listens for new object creation events in the S3 bucket.
3. **Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions orchestrate the workflow by triggering two ECS tasks:
   - **Validation Task**: Validates and cleans the data.
   - **Transformation Task**: Computes KPIs and writes results to DynamoDB.
4. **Storage**: Cleaned data is stored in a separate S3 bucket, and computed KPIs are written to DynamoDB tables.
5. **Logging & Monitoring**: CloudWatch Logs track task execution and provide error alerts.

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **File Upload**: A flat file containing transactional data is uploaded to the designated S3 bucket.
2. **EventBridge Rule**: An EventBridge rule detects the file upload event and triggers the Step Function.
3. **Step Function Execution**:
   - **Validation Task**: The first ECS task reads the file, validates its structure, and performs data cleaning. If errors are found, the pipeline exits gracefully.
   - **Transformation Task**: The second ECS task processes the cleaned data, computes KPIs, and stores the results in DynamoDB.
4. **Data Storage**:
   - Validated and cleaned data is written to a separate S3 bucket.
   - Computed KPIs are stored in DynamoDB tables.
5. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs capture task execution details and generate alerts for failures.

## Key Components

### Amazon S3
- **Input Bucket**: Stores raw transactional data files.
- **Output Bucket**: Stores validated and cleaned data files.
- Files are processed and moved between buckets as part of the pipeline.

### Amazon EventBridge
- Listens for S3 object creation events (`s3:ObjectCreated:*`).
- Triggers the Step Function upon detecting a new file.

### AWS Step Functions
- Orchestrates the ECS tasks.
- Implements failure paths, branching logic, and timeouts for robust error handling.

### Amazon ECS Tasks
- **Validation Task**:
  - Reads raw data from the S3 input bucket.
  - Validates and cleans the data.
  - Writes cleaned data to the S3 output bucket.
- **Transformation Task**:
  - Reads cleaned data from the S3 output bucket.
  - Computes business KPIs.
  - Writes results to DynamoDB tables.

### Amazon DynamoDB
- **KPI Tables**:
  - Optimized for querying KPIs using partition keys, sort keys, and secondary indexes.
  - Example: `OrdersKPI` table with `OrderDate` as the partition key and `ProductID` as the sort key.

### CloudWatch Logs & Monitoring
- Tracks ECS task execution and logs errors.
- Generates alerts for pipeline failures or anomalies.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured.
- Docker installed for containerization.
- IAM roles and permissions set up for S3, ECS, EventBridge, Step Functions, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch.

### Steps
1. **Create S3 Buckets**:
   - Create an input bucket for raw data.
   - Create an output bucket for cleaned data.
2. **Set Up EventBridge Rule**:
   - Configure an EventBridge rule to listen for `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events in the input bucket.
   - Set the target as the Step Function state machine.
3. **Deploy ECS Tasks**:
   - Build Docker images for the validation and transformation tasks.
   - Push the images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
   - Create ECS task definitions and services.
4. **Configure Step Functions**:
   - Define a state machine to orchestrate the ECS tasks.
   - Add error handling, retries, and timeouts.
5. **Set Up DynamoDB Tables**:
   - Create tables for storing KPIs.
   - Define partition keys, sort keys, and secondary indexes.
6. **Enable CloudWatch Logging**:
   - Configure logging for ECS tasks and Step Functions.
   - Set up alerts for critical errors.

## Error Handling

- **Validation Task**:
  - Rejects malformed or incomplete data.
  - Logs errors to CloudWatch and exits the pipeline gracefully.
- **Transformation Task**:
  - Handles errors during KPI computation.
  - Logs detailed error messages for debugging.
- **Step Functions**:
  - Implements retry policies and fallback mechanisms.
  - Sends notifications for unresolved failures.

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

- **CloudWatch Metrics**:
  - Track ECS task success/failure rates.
  - Monitor Step Function execution times.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**:
  - Generate alerts for pipeline failures or delays.
- **Log Analysis**:
  - Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to analyze task execution logs.

## KPIs Computed

The pipeline computes two types of KPIs to support operational analytics for the e-commerce platform. These KPIs are stored in Amazon DynamoDB tables, optimized for efficient querying.

### Category-Level KPIs (Per Category, Per Day)

These KPIs provide insights into the performance of individual product categories on a daily basis. The attributes include:

| **Attribute**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `category`            | Product category (e.g., Electronics, Apparel).                                  |
| `order_date`          | Date of the summarized orders.                                                 |
| `daily_revenue`       | Total revenue generated from that category for the day.                        |
| `avg_order_value`     | Average value of individual orders in the category.                            |
| `avg_return_rate`     | Percentage of returned orders for the category.                                |


### Order-Level KPIs (Per Day)

These KPIs summarize the overall performance of orders placed on the platform on a daily basis. The attributes include:

| **Attribute**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `order_date`          | Date of the summarized orders.                                                 |
| `total_orders`        | Count of unique orders placed on the platform.                                 |
| `total_revenue`       | Total revenue generated from all orders.                                       |
| `total_items_sold`    | Total number of items sold across all orders.                                  |
| `return_rate`         | Percentage of orders that were returned.                                       |
| `unique_customers`    | Number of distinct customers who placed orders.                                |
